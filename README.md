# mangaplus-ripper 
A bit of code I wrote to automatically rip images from [Shueisha's MangaPlus service](https://mangaplus.shueisha.co.jp/).

Usage:

1. Visit the website linked above and open a chapter you want to save
2. Paste this in the console and enter
3. ???
4. Profit

Notes:

* You need to scroll down and load all pages before using it. I'm still trying to work around this.
* If you want high-quality rips, don't forget to set the image quality on the top right :)
* It won't work for chapters unavailable on the web version (for currently releasing series, the public ones are only the first and last six chapters), even if you have a link, because it'll lead to a 404 page.

If anyone manages to make a working script for the mobile app(s) please let me know, I'm not a mobile programmer :)
